Abstract = {Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease that results in millions of cases
   and deaths annually. The development of a fast computational method that
   identifies secretory proteins of the malaria parasite is important for
   research on antimalarial drugs and vaccines. Thus, a method was
   developed to identify the secretory proteins of malaria parasites. In
   this method, a reduced alphabet was selected to recode the original
   protein sequence. A feature synthesis method was used to synthesise
   three different types of feature information. Finally, the random forest
   method was used as a classifier to identify the secretory proteins. In
   addition, a web server was developed to share the proposed algorithm.
   Experiments using the benchmark dataset demonstrated that the overall
   accuracy achieved by the proposed method was greater than 97.8 percent
   using the 10-fold cross-validation method. Furthermore, the reduced
   schemes and characteristic performance analyses are discussed.},
